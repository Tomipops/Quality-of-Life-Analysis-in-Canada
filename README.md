# Quality-of-Life-Analysis-in-Canada
Analysis of Mental Health and Discrimination Using R Programming.

Introduction:
This project explores two quality-of-life metrics in Canada: Mental Health and Discrimination under Good Governance. It uses data from Statistics Canada to uncover insights into demographic trends, workplace discrimination, and mental health perceptions, leveraging R programming for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Objectives:
Analyze discrimination trends among visible minorities.
Investigate the impact of COVID-19 on workplace discrimination.
Examine mental health perceptions across different age groups.

Tools and Technologies:
R Programming
Libraries: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyverse
Data Source: Statistics Canada

Key Findings:
Black, Filipino, and Chinese recorded the highest percentage of workplace discrimination exceeding 20%
Workplace discrimination dropped from over 43% pre-COVID to 25% during COVID, and this is linked to remote work.
Excellent perceived mental health improves with age, rising from 61.6% (15–24 years) to 85.3% (65+ years).

How to Use:
Run the R scripts (discrimination_analysis.R and mental_health_analysis.R) on the provided datasets (Discrimination_clean.csv and Mental_Health.csv)
View the presentation (Quality_of_Life_Presentation.pptx) for a summary of findings.

Recommendations:
Develop mental health programs targeting young adults (15–24 years).
Address discrimination in visible minority groups with targeted policies.
